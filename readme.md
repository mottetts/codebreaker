# Codebreaker: A safe-cracking puzzler made in Python

## version 0.1

Codebreaker includes four difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard and expert. The level must be specified in a command-line argument when running the program, e.g.:

_python codebreaker.py hard_

A random number combination is generated at the start of the game; you have ten chances to guess it.

Depending on level of difficulty, the combo will be 3 or 4 digits long.

Depending on difficulty, you are given hints as to which digits in your guess were right, or how many were right, after each incorrect guess.

An award of bragging rights and a stash of virtual loot await the lucky victor.

Happy codebreaking!
